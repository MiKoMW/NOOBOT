# PortalAPI for NodeJS
A zoo of API wrapper for connecting to DialPort (Node version)

# What you need to do:

All you need to do is go to the /api/bot folder and put your bot in it just as the toy example, then change the namings accordingly. Everything else should've been taken care of by us. :)

# Run
```
npm install
npm start
```

Then Portal can POST on 3000 for your bot.
